xcape: Fast convective parameters for numpy, dask, and xarray
=============================================================

**xcape** provides an efficient workflow for the calculation of parameters commonly used in meteorology, allowing 
for post-processing of 4D gridded model or observed data using xarray for parameters including Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Storm Relative Helicity (SRH). This is made possible by leveraging wrapped fortran routines and numpy and allows for process parallelization via **Dask**.
